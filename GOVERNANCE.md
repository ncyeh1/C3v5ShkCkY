# FerrisKey Governance

FerrisKey is an open-source project developed under a lightweight meritocratic governance model.

## 🧠 Mission

To provide a modern, cloud-native, high-performance IAM system, built with Rust and React, for developers and organizations seeking control, security, and clarity.

## 👥 Maintainers

See [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md) for the current list.

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing releases and tagging versions
- Leading architectural decisions
- Fostering an open and welcoming community

---

## 🔄 Decision Making

We prefer **lazy consensus**. If no one objects to a proposal within 72 hours, it is accepted.
In case of disagreements, maintainers vote. Majority wins.

For major changes, an [RFC](https://github.com/ferriskey/ferriskey/discussions) should be proposed via GitHub Discussions.

## 🧑‍💻 Becoming a Maintainer

Anyone can become a maintainer by:

- Consistently contributing high-quality code or docs
- Participating in code reviews and discussions
- Demonstrating good judgment and community spirit

New maintainers must be approved by **2 existing maintainers**.
